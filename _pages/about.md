I am an undergraduate in the Paul G. Allen school at the University of Washington studying computer science and mathematics. My current interests are in machine learning for geolocation and algebraic topology. My complete CV can be found [here](http://soldenstoll.github.io/cv/). Outside of academics, I enjoy watching soccer, skiing, and traveling. Additionally, I enjoy training and competing in triathlon. So far I have completed 3 half-iron distance events, and I plan to do much more.
